I'm an undergraduate student at MIT double majoring in physics and math. I am generally interested in learning about the intersection between chemistry and quantum physics; both in probing chemical phenomena at the atomic and molecular scale and applying methods from inorganic chemistry and materials science for new physics. I also like to think about statistics, computation, and algorithms. In my free time, I enjoy playing the clarinet, running, taking photos, reading history books, and cheering for the Ravens, Celtics, and Red Sox.

**What are you up to?**

I am a summer intern at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) studying error mitigation and correction strategies for practical quantum computation. Additionally, I am 
* Studying novel metallo-organic systems for quantum sensing applications in the [Freedman lab](https://freedmanlab-mit.com/) at MIT
* Expanding on my work on stochastic methods for solid state magnetism from the [MIT Physics Directed Reading Program](https://phys-drp.mit.edu/) 
* Maintaining this website
