I'm an graduate student at Princeton University studying AMO physics in Prof. [Lawrence Cheuk's group](https://sites.google.com/view/cheuk-lab/). I grew up in Maryland and developed my love for science while attending [Montgomery Blair High School](https://www.mbhsmagnet.org/magnet) and later MIT, where I majored in physics and math. In undergrad, I studied synthesis, spectroscopy, and quantum chemical theory towards quantum control of metal-complex molecules in Prof. [Danna Freedman's group](https://freedmanlab-mit.com/) and error suppression strategies for practical quantum computation at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/). Generally, I am interested in the intersection between atomic and molecular structure with quantum and many-body physics. In my free time, I enjoy thinking about statistics, computation, and algorithms, pursuing strange computational physics projects, playing the clarinet, running, taking photos, reading history books, and cheering for the Ravens, Celtics, and Red Sox.
