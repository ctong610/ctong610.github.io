Welcome to the first of hopefully many posts on my blog. For the past few years, I have had some mental notion of my ideal presence on the internet via some series of writing. In fact, the project that holds the files this site is built on is locally dated to January 2023, 18 months before when I am actually writing this text. Of course, in the intervening time period (as well as in all the time before I started web design with Jekyll), my mental picture of the ideal personal website has also shifted through new lived experiences. I think the mental barrier mostly came from tough questions for myself, such as:

-_Writing well takes a lot of time and effort, would I rather be doing something else?_

-_Will anyone happen to come across my writing?_

-_Even if they do, would they even care enough to read this content? Am I capable of writing about something that is generally interesting and insightful or are the things I write about more of a personal idiosyncracy?_

I think most of my indecision is due to the fact that I couldn't figure out if the time and effort that goes into maintaining a personal website and blog that is regularly updated was worth it without comprehensively thinking about the above questions. And as I had some general laziness/apathy about these topics during a particularly busy period of school, I admittedly did not put forth the appropriate level of mental effort to confront those questions. However, as demonstrated by your presence on my blog, I came to some positive conclusions about these questions. Naturally, I wanted to make a meta-discussion as my first post, detailing why I want this medium to exist in the first place:

**1) Personal writing practice**

From a purely selfish perspective, I wanted to have more chances to write content beyond specific assignments for school and jotting down notes for personal reference. Even if not a single other person reads the content here, having an online platform that I can pretend that other people will read imposes a certain bar of formality and rigor to communicating my ideas that I wouldn't otherwise have. By raising that standard, I hope to have more space for self-reflection and improvement through more precise thinking and communication of ideas. Additionally, I feel that my first attempt at forming a sentence is often quite awkward, even in writing about my own work or research. I hope that with more experience writing online about specific topics of my choice instead of more rigid school assignments, I can better develop a go-to personal writing style into which my sentences flow easily into by default. Although the personal formality standard is something I will seek to achieve with every post, my goal is that in a few years, these first posts will be some level of cringe-inducing because the years of practice will have made my writing so much more natural.

**2) Pedagogical practice**

I have had a decently broad experience as a classroom student across different fields that relate in subtle ways. This expereince has allowed me to develop an assortment of deeper connections between fields that are more than would meet the eye in any individual course or textbook, as well as semi-informed opinions about how these topics should be presented in the classroom. Many of these concepts have just been random ideas that pop in and out of my head at various times, and I will admit that some motivation for writing this blog stems from the fear that these one of these random ideas will pop out of my head forever. Thus, a natural goal here is to communicate these ideas in a clear manner, delivering scientific concepts in a conversationally natural fashion. One day, I hope to write something that is as clear as a textbook yet as readable as a novel, but this must be impossible if I do not start chipping away at it sentence by sentence. Finally, this point was my strongest personal answer to the "does anyone care" question - at the end of the day, I will write about things that I care about, and I hope I can convey that to you if you give me the chance.

**3) Asserting an internet presence**

Large internet platforms have fundamentally favored short-engagement content, such as 280 character tweets and short videos on TikTok and Vine before that. However, many of the topics I want to discuss are better suited in the longer form. I hope that by achieving the first two objectives sufficiently well, a personal website-blog provides a better medium on which one can spend a few hours to read and learn something new or spark new inspirations. Compared to the standard short content associated with the standard large internet platform, I would prefer that the flexibility that a personal site affords in tailoring communication towards my goals.

**4) A chance for self reflection**

Finally and perhaps most importantly, I hope this blog provides a medium for others to give honest feedback on my writing and communication skills. I am interested in any sort of reflections on the grand schemes of writing style to specific questions of pedagogical choices in specific choices for topics to assume and topics to demonstrate. Unlike the average textbook written by some faceless person at Springer, I will be very accessible and transparent - please write to me at the name of the blog at gmail dot com with any comments or concerns.

To wrap up this post, I hope to write some mixture of short reflective posts like this one with textbook-like chapters with conversational style to best achieve these four goals. However, I'm very unsure of what the best combination is - I am definitely seeking feedback about how to strike the right meta-balance and would love to hear from you about that. See you around for the first non-meta discussion soon!
